# Vorschrift zum Gott, dem wir dienen

> _I once read an article about a law that had been passed that served no one living today and only doomed those of a later generation to do more work. The law was passed in order to preserve a certain part of cultural heritage. It was, essentially, made for something other than us humans._
> 
> _This is an example of a God we serve. Another example would be that of (scientific) progress, or that of economy. Of course, both of these can be translated to human wealth in many aspects: easier lifes, in essence. But often times I feel that the things that we work for, these greater concepts, are essentially something that is not human nor serves us._
> 
> _Another way to interpret gods is to analyze the way we act. Or, let's turn this around: Religious people often_ speak _about the god they serve, and they could "name" those gods/that god (e.g.: "the Christian god"). That I find a very symbolic act: Jesus himself gave us the example that we should_ live _in certain ways, not that we should_ say _that we live in a certain way or only_ talk _about living in a certain way._
> 
> _This means: In order to find the gods we serve, we sould analyze how we act and not just listen to what god we_ say _we serve. This also excludes having chosen one for ourselves: If we live in the way that pertains to that god, only_ then _do we have the right to claim that we serve him. (And, as written in_ What we say, _then we might not even feel that we have to claim that.)_

# People scare me if they're unable to change

> _„People scare me if they’re **unable to change,** because being unable to change also means being unable to understand others – to understand me. In the same way that movement means being alive, to me, people who find themselves bound by their ways permanently seem to me more like automatons or NPCs. They cannot be talked with. Of course, me talking about change here doesn’t mean that understanding another means somehow changing, or changing into them. Being unable to change simply means missing the potential to potentially accept the other’s position, even if we wouldn’t really accept it. These people scare me in the same way people are afraid of madness. If Einstein is to be believed, madness means doing the same thing over and over again and expecting the same result. If I explain myself ten or twenty times to my mother and she still treats me the same even after I’ve exhausted my mental and emotional capabilities of explaining myself, my only option left is accepting that she is unable to change. She therein becomes someone I do not longer understand – terrifyingly incalcuable through her immense calcuability, an estranged human.“_

# Schöne Vorschrift zu Licht und Dunkelheit

> **_Darkness_** _means staying up late (more of the dark parts of the day),_ **_light_** _means rising early morning. (more light) Dark is smaller worlds (Große Welten, kleine Welten) (less is seen in darkness), light means bigger world. Light means contact, dark means solitude. Now; this is not meant in a judging way. Light is no better than dark. Darkness means making the world one’s own and retreating into oneself, finding yourself there. Light means giving yourself to the world (Hingabe) in a loving way. It is important to achieve an equilibrium of the two. Too much darkness means isolating oneself and possibly becoming lost in one’s own ways. Too much light means becoming a slave to the world and losing oneself in never reflecting._
> 
> **_Life,_** _on the one hand, means people. On the other hand, it means work. Confrontation with topics that are not just of our own choosing. It’s contrast, Reibung. The unexpected; differences we can notice. Ungemütliches through which we earn our enjoyment and fall out of decadence. Basically: Anything we would miss spending all day in bed, only getting up for food and fundamental needs – that would be life._

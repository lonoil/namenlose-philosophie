# Vorschrift dazu, zu wem andere uns machen

> _There are as many versions of me as there are people I know. I get reborn with each person I get to know, and am thrown into past lives as I meet the people I_ do _know._
> 
> _As I enter a new school, there are many things I want: I want friends. I want to be seen as someone sociable. As an open-minded person. All of these are things I envision as I lie in bed before my first day there. Then, I step before class. The first impression is the most important one. Then, I form an impression in the others' minds. The person I am to be is shaped there._
> 
> _But why is that? Why not just take the second day as well, and the third? We might change the other's opinion of us. The answer: Because we don't only act as_ we _want, and as_ we _see ourselves. But rather do we act as we believe_ others _see us._
> 
> _Why is that: Because of suggestion. And we don't even need the others to suggest us something: We suggest ourselves this. It's a multi-step process: We believe the others see us like this, and we imagine that, through their eyes, we really are as though we believe that they believe we are. Through that imagination we suggest ourselves this, because in that picture, we_ are _like this. Because, deep down, there is a reason that we adhere to that version of ourselves we believe others to have of us: Because we believe we suggested them that version ourselves, and in being capable of doing that, we also accept that picture of ourselves._
> 
> _And then, this is an interesting point: Those who know us the longest are probably the ones who know us worst. If we don't see them for a time, they still remember us as we were, and maybe they don't want us to change (because we don't want change? Or they see that they might have missed out on something of us), or they don't believe in the possibility. Either way they subconsciously (try to) bind us to our past selves. And sometimes they succeed._
> 
> _In that way as well do we see that (Wirkung): Against our parents we may stand powerless in regards to the effect. They make us children again. Not because they act as parents, but because they treat us the way they know us._

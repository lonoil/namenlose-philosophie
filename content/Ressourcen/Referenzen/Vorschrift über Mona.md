# Vorschrift über Mona

> _Here was a girl who did not enjoy the goodwill of those around her - they thought her strange. What they thought so strange was the inquisitive way she had around her: If you told her something, she would dig deeper, interestedly._
> 
> _What I found so interesting about that was firstly the thought that the others maybe did not like her because they had something to hide. I mean projection when I say that._
> 
> _What actually made her wonderful in my eyes was exactly that fact: She would put absolute trust in you. She would, in trusting you, bind you to your words and actions. She would_ believe you _if you told her something about yourself, and firstly bind you to those words because you had to uphold what you told her (she would remember it) and secondly because of your own conscience._

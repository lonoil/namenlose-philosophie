# Vorschrift zu Barbaras Decodieren

> One of my teachers knew if we were lying to her. She also knew what we actually meant, even if we didn't intend to pass that information to her. In some cases she could even see things about us that we ourselves had not seen. At one point it went so far that I only needed to speak with her in my mind in order to find truth about myself because I knew I could not lie to her. I think you've done your job as a teacher well if you don't even need to be there to continue teaching. Anyways the first layer of decoding is something we all can do. Because it is a matter of choice, not one of ability. First, we need to choose not to accept what others try to present us about themselves. Second, we need to trust ourselves in regards to our own interpretations. Because, let's face it in the most seldom cases do we actually mean what we say. And I don't just mean the blatant cases of "How are you?" - "I'm fine".
